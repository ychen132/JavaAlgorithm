Makes assumptions about the data
Doesnt use comparision
Counts the number of occurrences of each value
Only works with non-negative discrete values
Values must be within a specific range


Assumes we have values between 1 & 10
We have 10 possible values, therefore create a counting array of length 10
Traverse the input array from left to right
Use counting array to track the number of how many of each value are in the input array
Using the counts in the counting array, write the values in sorted order to the input array

Not an in-place algorithm
O(n)--can achieve this because we 're making assumptions about the data we're sorting
More steps needed for stable sort
