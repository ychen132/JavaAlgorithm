Makes Assumption about the data
Data must have same radix and width
Because of this, data must be integers or strings
Sort based on each individual digit or letter position
Start at the rightmost position
Must use a stable sort algorithm at each stage
Counting sort is often used as the sort algorithm for radix sort ---must be stable counting sort
O(n)- can achieve this because we are making assumption about the data
Often runs slower than O(nlogn) because of the overhead involved
Stable
