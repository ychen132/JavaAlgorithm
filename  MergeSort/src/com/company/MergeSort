Divide and conquer Algorithm
Recursive
Two phases: Splitting and Merging
Logical splitting- no new arrays
Start with Unsorted array
Divide the array into two arrays, one left one right
split left right arrays again until only one element each
Merge every left/right pair of sibling arrays into a sorted array
After first merge -- numbers of two element sorted arrays
keep merging until there is one array
Not in place. use temporary arrays
O(nlogn)-base 2
Stable algorithm
