Variation of Insertion Sort
Insertion sort chooses which element to insertion using a gap of 1
ShellSort starts out using a larger gap value
As the algorithm runs, that gap is reduced
reduce the amount of shifting required
The last gap value is always 1
Knuth Sequence determines gap
gap is calculated using (3^k-1)/2
Set k based on the length of the array
We want the gap to be as close as possible to the length of the array we want to sort, without being greater than the length
Example base our gap on the length. Initialize the gap to array.length/2
On each iteration, we' ll divide the gap value by 2
gap value will be 3 then 1

In-place Algorithm
Difficult to nail down the time complexity since it depends on the gap; worst case at O(n^2); but it can perform better
Unstable Algorithm
Doesn't require as much shifting
