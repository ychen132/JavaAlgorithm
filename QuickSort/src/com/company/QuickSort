Divide and Conquer algorithm
Recursive
Uses a pivot element to partition the array into 2 parts
Element< pivot to the left, > pivot to the right
Repeat for the left and right array until partitioning become the array into a serious of 1-element array
In-place
O(nlogn)-base 2, worst case quadratic
Unstable algorithm
