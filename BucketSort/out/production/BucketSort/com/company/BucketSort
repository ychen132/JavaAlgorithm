Distribute the items into Buckets based on their hash values (Scattering phase)
Sort the items in each bucket
Merge the buckets--concatenate them
A generalization of counting sort
The values in bucket X must be greater than the values in Bucket X-1 and less than the values of Bucket X+1
The hashing function must meet this requirements
Not in-place
Stability will depend on sort algorithm used to sort the buckets-ideally, you want a stable sort
To achieve O(n), must have only one item per bucket
Insertion sort is often used to sort the buckets because it is fast when the numbers of items is small
